Travel Planner App

I. Project Description

    Create a mobile app that assists travelers in planning their trips and provides information about destinations, attractions, accommodations, and local recommendations.

II. Problem Addressing

    Travelers often face challenges in organizing and finding reliable information about their trips, leading to inefficient planning and missed opportunities to explore the best of a destination.
    The app aims to address these problems by providing a centralized platform with comprehensive travel information, personalized recommendations, and trip planning tools.

III. Platform

    Develop the app for both Android and iOS platforms to reach a wider audience of travelers.

IV. Front/Back End Support

    Front-end: Use modern mobile app development frameworks like React Native or Flutter to ensure cross-platform compatibility and efficient user interface development.
    Back-end: Utilize a server-side technology stack (e.g., Node.js, Django) to handle data storage, user authentication, and API integrations.

V. Functionality

    User Registration and Profile Management: Allow users to create accounts, manage personal information, and store their preferences.
    Destination Search: Enable users to search for specific destinations, view detailed information about each location, including attractions, restaurants, and activities.
    Trip Planning: Provide users with tools to create and manage trip itineraries, including adding attractions, setting reminders, and organizing daily schedules.
    Recommendations: Offer personalized recommendations based on user preferences, previous trips, and popular destinations.
    Real-time Updates: Integrate with external APIs to provide real-time flight updates, weather information, and local events happening during the user's travel dates.
    Social Features: Implement social sharing functionality to allow users to share their itineraries, experiences, and recommendations with friends and fellow travelers.

VI. Design (Wireframes)

    Create wireframes and UI/UX designs for key screens, including the home screen, destination details, trip planner, user profile, and search results.
    Focus on a user-friendly interface, intuitive navigation, visually appealing layouts, and a consistent design language.
